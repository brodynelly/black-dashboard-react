# Translation Website: A Personal Project

## Why I created this website
- I wanted to learn Spanish, but I found it hard to memorize vocabulary and grammar rules.
- I decided to create a website that allows me to read articles in Spanish and translate specific terms using Google Translate API.
- I thought this would be a fun and effective way to improve my reading comprehension and learn new words in context.

## How I created this website
- I used React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, to create the front-end of the website.
- I used HTML and CSS to structure and style the web pages.
- I used Node.js and npm to run the back-end of the website and install the dependencies.
- I used Google Translate API to enable the translation functionality.

## How this website helps me learn Spanish
- I can choose any article in Spanish that interests me and paste the URL into the input box.
- I can select the source and target languages from the drop-down menus.
- I can see the translated text in the output box and copy or share it if I want.
- I can learn new words and phrases by comparing the original and translated texts.
- I can practice my pronunciation by listening to the audio of the texts.
